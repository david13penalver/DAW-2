# Introduction [(Up)](#table-of-contents)

## Introduction 
The server is dedicated only to:
- Receive customer requests
- Access to the DB
- Return the data to the client
  - The client is responsible of mounting the data in the view

## Statis and Dynamic Web Pages [(Up)](#table-of-contents)

- Statics: the content is always the same
- Dynamic: the content is generated in real time
  - Depending on the option
  - We need an interpreter of the language used to generate the content
  - We need a DBMS (DataBase Manager System)
